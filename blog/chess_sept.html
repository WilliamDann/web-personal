						<h1># A Win Against a GM (in a simul)</h1>

						<br>

						<h2>## Intro</h2>
						<p>

								I have been a somewhat active chess player since I started playing in tournament chess in 2018. At the time, I was 16 and understood basically nothing about the game of chess. Sure, I could mostly not blunder my pieces, but anything deeper than that was basically lost on me. Since then, I've worked a lot on understanding the game at a continually higher level - and I've made some progress! My rating online has risen from ~600 to ~2150, so I guess I have started to understand some parts of the game. That said, learning how the game of chess is played is a continual process that isn't even finished and I feel as if I'm only really at the start of my understanding of the game.
								<br><br>

								I have three main goals with reviewing my games here. I would like to 1) Share my games with those interested, 2) Use this opportunity to improve my chess through analysis, and 3) Improve this page's ability to display chess information. 
								<br><br>
								The first is simple - I want to have a space where those who are interested can check up on my chess. I'm going to try to stike a balance between chessic content for the chess players I know, and simplicity for the non-chess-players who are still interested. That's not an easy balance to strike, as every chess communicator knows, but that's the goal!
								<br><br>
								As many strong players have stated, analysis of your own games is very important in improving your game as a whole. My second goal is simply to give me a better reason than "just do it lol". I get the chance to share my thoughts, stories, ideas, and all that while still getting the change to dig deeper into the chessic content of the games. Sounds like fun to me! 
								<br><br>
								The last goal is about improvment of this website. I could just use a lichess embedded board, and I may do that for awhile, but I would like to create a plesant reading experince for chess content. This has a portion of the chessic content vs. simplicity tension that was noted before, as many non-chess players don't know how to read chess notation. This will be an evoloving issue that will take lots of trial and error to get right, but I'm excited for the chance to tackle the problem.
								<br><br>
								That is to say, if you're interested in my games stick around! I'll be posting updates on my chess every so often :)

						<h2>## GM Kayden Troff Simul</h2>
						<br>
						<p>
								I was invited to play in a simul with <a href="https://ratings.fide.com/profile/2047896">Grandmaster Kayden Troff</a> at Grand Knights Chess Academy where I work as a chess coach. Going into the match, my main goal was simply to not look like an idiot, as I know that this was quite a strong chess player. I had played a simul game against <a href="https://ratings.fide.com/profile/700088">Grandmaster Susan Polgar</a> a few months before, where I managed to play a good game, despite having lost. So, I knew it was possible, I just had to bring my best.

								Kayden played an opening that I'd played around with for awhile myself, 1. b3. Also known as the Nimzowitsch-Larsen attack (named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aron_Nimzowitsch">Aaron Nimzowitsch</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bent_Larsen">Bent Larsen</a>), this is a unconventional approach from the standpoint of modern openings:

						<br><br>
						<h1>GM Kayden Troff - William Dann</h1>
						<h2>
								1. b3  e5 	<br>
								2. Bb2 Nc6 	<br>
								3. e3  d5 	<br>
						</h2>
						
						<div id="board1" style="width: 400px"></div>
						<br>
						The approach I usually take with white is playing 4. Bb5 to pin the knight the knight on c6. This removes it as a defender of the central e5 pawn (in front of black's king) as the white bishop could take the black king, were the black knight to move. Black usually plays 4... Bd6 to protect the pawn, who has just lost a defender to the pin. After this white can play 5. f4!? (!? means interesting move in chess writing) keeping pressure on the center pawn. The idea of playing an opening like this is to control the center squares from afar, rather than up close. Controlling the middle of the chess board is a core tennant of chess strategy, this is simply another way of applying that idea.

						<br><br>
						<h2>
								4. Nf3!? Bd6 <br>
								5. Bb5   f6 <br>
						</h2>

						<div id="board2" style="width: 400px"></div>
						<br><br>

						So far, everything has been about pressure on the e5 point. Kayden went in a different direction than the one I'd know about. After the game he stated that he'd studied some of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen">Magnus Carlsen</a>'s Games where we chose this line.

						<h2>
								6. c4 Ne7?! 	<br>
								7. Nc3 a6 		<br>
								8. Bxc6+ bxc6 <br>
						</h2>


						<div id="board3" style="width: 400px"></div>
						<br><br>

						White has so far managed to give me an awkward position from attacking my center points. I cannot give them up - so I decided upon adopting this structure and strange positioning for the knight on e7 to try and hold on to the e5 and d5 points. Like I said before - control of the center is the height of chess strategy, so we're both trying to control those squares.

						<h2>
								9. d4 e4!?		<br>
								10. c5 exf3		<br>
								11. Qxf3 Bf5	<br>
								12. cxd6 cxd6	<br>
						</h2>
						
						<div id="board4" style="width: 400px"></div>
						<br><br>

						What just happened? The bishop on d6 was traded for the knight on f3, as we both lost a peice. I was happy to sneak in the move ...Bf5, getting a good diagional for my bishop while this little exchange was occoring. It seems somewhat complicated, but my bishop was trapped, so white was always going to regain the piece he lost on f3.

						My next move, 13... h5 is setting a a very sneaky trap. Will white fall for it?

						<br><br>

						<h2>
								13. O-O h5!? (setting a little trap)	<br>
								14. Ba3 Bg4?!	<br>
								15. Qf4 Nc8		<br>
								16. e4! Qa5		<br>
								17. Na4 O-O		<br>
								18. f3  Bd7		<br>
								19. Bxd6? (the trap worked!)	<br>
						</h2>

						<div id="board5" style="width: 400px"></div>
						<br><br>
						
						This trap is not something Kayden would have fallen for in a real game. The trouble with simuls is that your attention is split across many games and often times you miss little tactical deatils. I knew this from my own experince with giving simuls - so I thought it was a decent try to win the game, which ended up working out! Honestly, it's a good thing it did, because I was starting to lose control of my center points and therefor I was starting to lose control of the game.

						<br><br>
						<h2>
								19... g5! (this removes the queen as as a defender of the bishop on d6) <br>
								20. Bc7 Qxa4! (as the white queen is hanging, if they take ours, we take theirs) <br>
								21. Qg3 Qxd4+ <br>
								22. Kh1 -+	<br>
						</h2>

						<div id="board6" style="width: 400px"></div>
						<br><br>

						Black is now up a peice (the knight on c8) and should win the game. Kayden fought very hard to try and survive, but in the end I was able to beat back my nerves and finish the game.

						<br><br>
						<h2>0 - 1, Black Wins.</h2>
						<br>

						<h2>## Summary</h2>
						<br>
						I used my experince gained from coaching to win this game. I know from giving simuls to classes of students that it's very easy to miss tactics when you're playing many games at once. I used this information to set a little trap with 13...h5!? which paid off a few moves later. If this trap had not worked, I would have surley lost the game as my position wasn't so good. Well, I guess sometimes it's okay to be lucky! Proud of this game despite it's flaws and trickery.
